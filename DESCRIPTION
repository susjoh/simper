Title: Simulates SNP Datasets For Simple And Complex Pedigrees With Recombination.

Description: This package simulates SNP data sets for simple and complex pedigrees. Founder
    individuals are assigned haplotypes based on founder allele frequencies. Haplotypes
    are then transmitted to descendants with recombination sampled from linkage map
    distances. Crossover positions are reported alongside datasets. Future versions will
    account for additional factors such as crossover intereference.
