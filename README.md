# simperSNP

This package simulates SNP data sets for simple and complex pedigrees. Founder individuals are assigned haplotypes based on founder allele frequencies. Haplotypes are then transmitted to descendants with recombination sampled from linkage map distances. Crossover positions are reported alongside datasets. 

This package is still in progress.

Plans for future versions:
* Modelling of crossover intereference.
* Sampling founders based on haplotype frequencies
* Simulation of QTL of specified effect sizes
* Gene-drop analyses accounting for population age structure
